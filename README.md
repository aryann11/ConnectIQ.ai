## üöÄ Core Features  

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Job Post Extraction  
- Scrapes structured job postings directly from career pages using a custom web scraper powered by `langchain_community.document_loaders`.  
- Processes unstructured HTML content into actionable job details, including `company`, `role`, `experience`, `skills`, and `description`.  

### üìä Portfolio Recommendation System  
- Utilizes **ChromaDB** as a persistent vector database for efficient skill-based portfolio matching.  
- Dynamically queries portfolio projects based on job requirements using cosine similarity on embedded vectors.  

### ü§ñ Cold Email Generation  
- Employs **Groq LLM (Llama-3.1-70b-versatile)** for natural language generation.  
- Tailors email drafts based on job descriptions, extracted skills, and portfolio data to maximize client engagement.  
- Uses prompt engineering via **LangChain** for precise and structured email generation.  

### üß© Modular Architecture  
- Cleanly decouples scraping, database management, and AI tasks for maintainability and scalability.  
- Ensures that each module is independently testable, making it easier to extend functionality.
